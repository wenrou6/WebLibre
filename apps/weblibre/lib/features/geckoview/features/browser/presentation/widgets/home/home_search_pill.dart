/// live field here would compete with all three. Its only job is to make the
/// home surface read as the same page as the new-tab screen.
///
/// The QR and voice buttons are the same widgets [SearchField] mounts, but they
/// cannot write into a controller here because there is no field to write to —

/// the module list scrolls underneath it.
